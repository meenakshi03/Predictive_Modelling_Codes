       " 'The closing process for a VA loan went smoothly. But the loan servicing by this so-called bank is a complete disaster. I set up our loan for automatic payments using their clunky website. Unlike other banks with which I do business, the NASB website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries. For the first 10 months, payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled. However, when the escrow amount changed, NASB debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance -- unlike every other bank I have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited. NASB sent me a \"credit counseling letter\" telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of $40 and change .... and suggested credit counseling services. When I called their servicing department, the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current. Two weeks later, I received a total of two voice mail messages and an e-mail in a span of 20 minutes from NASB\\'s default department. The woman with whom I first spoke was rude, said she showed no record of my earlier call, it was my problem, and then hung up on me. The second agent, a man in their default department, said that he did not show that I had made any automatic payments and that NASB\\'s system was not set up to adjust anything. After having over 25 years of mortgage payments with various banks, I have never experienced such incompetence and rude service. I specifically instructed the last agent to request that they sell servicing of our loan to another bank that is capable of actually performing customer service for a veteran\\xa0',\n",

Mr. Kang also was \"sure\" our house would appraise\\xa0for $30k more than our house did, talking us into a loan that we didn\\'t end up appraising for and then causing us to have to refinance at only .4% lower than our current mortgage. Our appraiser was disorganized and called twice for pictures he forgot. He used poor comps. We were contacted several times to look at documents that were expired before we could even sign on (within minutes of the email notifications). Only good was the actual settlement with a very sweet and competent notary (and thank goodness we were done).

       " 'This loan started off quite well. Our rep, Donna, was friendly and quick to respond to questions. She clearly explained how things would unfold, and it all sounded great. What I didn\\'t count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife\\'s departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now \"too old.\" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn\\'t care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn\\'t kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn\\'t pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I\\'ve ever had. You owe it to yourself to work with another Bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers. If I could, I\\'d rate this Bank lower than one star',\n",

My original lender had offered to pay for my home appraisal in writing, and, wanting to compete, Kirk said he would pay for the appraisal (which he stated in writing) and asked for the letter the other lender had provided so he could get permission to have Pacific Beneficial pay for my appraisal. Kirk confirmed I would not be paying for the appraisal and was very happy with what Kirk was doing to accommodate me as a customer. However, when I closed on the home, the cost of the appraisal was on my Final Buyer’s Statement ($525). As Kirk had said that I would not be paying for the appraisal, I thought I would be reimbursed. I reached out to Kirk via email after close and got no further response than “We paid for appraisal upfront but we get reimbursed.” I then reached out to Kirk two times via email with no response. I then called the office and spoke to Kirk’s boss’ admin who instructed me to reach out to Kirk’s boss, Adam Carrion, which I did. It was only then that I received an email response from Kirk stating that the lender credit I received, which was less than the appraisal, was all I would receive to cover the cost, despite the fact that when I was entering into the loan Kirk told me that Pacific Beneficial would be paying for the appraisal and I would be receiving a lender credit. Kirk asked me to call him, which I did and left a voicemail, and he never called me back. I called Kirk again leaving a voicemail with no response. I then began reaching out to his boss Adam Carrion via email to continue to explain the situation. Only then did I receive an email from Kirk asking me to call him, which I did, left a voicemail, and received no response. I then called Adam and spoke to him on the phone and only then did I receive a call from Kirk, offering me a nominal amount of money. I stated that I wanted to be reimbursed for the entire appraisal amount and he said he would go back to the powers that be to see what he could do. I never heard from him. I reached out to Kirk and Adam via email to check in on status with no response. The next day I reached out again, voicing my displeasure and that I was going to take action via reviews. It was only then that I received an email from Kirk accusing me of extorting him. I want other potential customers to know about what occurred as not only was I misled, but I was treated terribly as a customer once Kirk had been paid his commission.

However, when I closed on the home, the cost of the appraisal was on my Final Buyer’s Statement ($525). As Kirk had said that I would not be paying for the appraisal, I thought I would be reimbursed. I reached out to Kirk via email after close and got no further response than “We paid for appraisal upfront but we get reimbursed.” I then reached out to Kirk two times via email with no response. I then called the office and spoke to Kirk’s boss’ admin who instructed me to reach out to Kirk’s boss, Adam Carrion, which I did. It was only then that I received an email response from Kirk stating that the lender credit I received, which was less than the appraisal, was all I would receive to cover the cost, despite the fact that when I was entering into the loan Kirk told me that Pacific Beneficial would be paying for the appraisal and I would be receiving a lender credit. Kirk asked me to call him, which I did and left a voicemail, and he never called me back. I called Kirk again leaving a voicemail with no response. I then began reaching out to his boss Adam Carrion via email to continue to explain the situation. Only then did I receive an email from Kirk asking me to call him, which I did, left a voicemail, and received no response. I then called Adam and spoke to him on the phone and only then did I receive a call from Kirk, offering me a nominal amount of money. I stated that I wanted to be reimbursed for the entire appraisal amount and he said he would go back to the powers that be to see what he could do. I never heard from him. I reached out to Kirk and Adam via email to check in on status with no response. The next day I reached out again, voicing my displeasure and that I was going to take action via reviews. It was only then that I received an email from Kirk accusing me of extorting him. I want other potential customers to know about what occurred as not only was I misled, but I was treated terribly as a customer once Kirk had been paid his commission. It is extremely disappointing that this brokerage would go to these lengths over $525 after the fact when they promised this a customer.\\r\\r\\n... Read More\\r\\r\\n        ',\n",

What I didn\\'t count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife\\'s departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now \"too old.\" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn\\'t care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn\\'t kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn\\'t pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I\\'ve ever had. You owe it to yourself to work with another Bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers. If I could, I\\'d rate this Bank lower than one star... Read More\\r\\r\\n        ',\n",

       " \"\\r\\r\\nI never write reviews but had to this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as I. That mistake was using North American Savings Bank over other lenders. I started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. Communication with the company was below average after I confirmed that I would be pursuing a loan with them. I had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. The company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn't. This led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. After having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. When I was able to reach the loan officer I was told that I would personally have to find additional comps in my area. I was more than a little annoyed as this is what I was going to be paying them for, however I complied. After contacting area realtors and securing what I believe were suitable comps I forwarded them to the officer. A week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. At that time I was told that my comps weren't sufficient and as a result they couldn't ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment's findings. As a result they would not be issuing me a loan. By the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. I should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. He did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. I'm now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that I can't use. In other words I will have to pay for a new assessment. I'm also out the money for credit reports and of course I'll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan I secure. I was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money I had spent. I expect to be paying for my mistake for years. I should point out that I refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues.

One huge error was the Loan Estimate had rolled in initial escrow funding into the loan amount when we expressly communicated at the beginning that we did not want to finance it but pay for it at closing from available funds.

There was no compassion and it came across as she was the word of GOD and I would have to bow her will. The company did not even offer any assistance for having to pay for the changes I had to do with my time and schedule as well as the airfare. They only care when it comes to getting your MONEY! With buying being stressful as it is, this was uncalled for from the companies side and they need to reevaluate their processes and get the understanding of what real customer service is- it is RESPECT of the customer and their time and lives!\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nSTAY far away from this company...

What I didn\\'t count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife\\'s departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now \"too old.\" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn\\'t care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn\\'t kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn\\'t pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I\\'ve ever had.

       " \"\\r\\r\\nI never write reviews but had to this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as I. That mistake was using North American Savings Bank over other lenders. I started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. Communication with the company was below average after I confirmed that I would be pursuing a loan with them. I had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. The company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn't. This led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. After having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. When I was able to reach the loan officer I was told that I would personally have to find additional comps in my area. I was more than a little annoyed as this is what I was going to be paying them for, however I complied. After contacting area realtors and securing what I believe were suitable comps I forwarded them to the officer. A week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. At that time I was told that my comps weren't sufficient and as a result they couldn't ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment's findings. As a result they would not be issuing me a loan. By the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. I should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. He did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. I'm now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that I can't use. In other words I will have to pay for a new assessment. I'm also out the money for credit reports and of course I'll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan I secure. I was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money I had spent. I expect to be paying for my mistake for years. I should point out that I refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues. I strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass North American Savings Bank no matter what they promise. Save yourself time, money and a lot of aggravation...
